    Objective:
    Try to answer as many of the questions as you can correctly
    
    How to Play:
    Choose how many math questions do you want
    
    You will be given a addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(x) and division(/) 
    You don't have a time limit but please try and speed run the quiz
    You have to answer correctly cause if you get it wrong you will get 
    a thumbs down if you get it right you will get a thumbs up
